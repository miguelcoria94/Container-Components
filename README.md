Container Components

There can be quite a bit of code involved in connecting a component to the store.

Putting all this code into the component with heavy rendering logice tends to cause bloated components and violateds the principle of seperation of concerns.

Therefore, it's a common pattern in Redux code to seperate presentaitional components from their connected couterparts, called containers.
